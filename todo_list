finish all players for CBA
do all the players for australia nbl (someone made all the players before, but its a broken file)

clean up the Japanese B.League (manually add transparent backgrounds thru photoshop)
fix some of the CBA logos (ugly on darkmode, need better transparency)

add more domestic names to
  - CBA
  - JPN B.League
  - VTB United
  - fantasy league
add more foreign names to all international leagues

money is too difficult to earn in international leagues
  difficult solution to this problem
    manually tune every teams finances to cheaper values?
    lower max salaries?
    raise salary cap?

all teams need colors

learn how to auto generate rosters (ask nicidob? probably need to learn python first)

show africa and south america some love
south east asia would probably like some league files, but little playerbase from SEA (who cares?)

create an olympic file (already done, but it kind of sucks)

FIX ALL INACCURACIES
  - some leagues dont have salary caps
  - min/max roster sizes aren't accurate in some leagues
  - foul rates are off by a bit
  - pace needs to be slightly adjusted for some leagues
  
Combine all international leagues into one
  do by continent, all leagues in one is too hard to sim
  need to make files for every international league first
  probably should just do a continental roster file, ft the best players from each continent
    - north america would dominate, need to be balanced
    - need foreign player restrictions (bug dumbmatter to add feature)
