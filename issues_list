This file has a list of things I need to fix with my files to make them a bit more accurate and enjoyable

clean up the Japanese B.League (manually add transparent backgrounds thru photoshop)
fix some of the CBA logos (ugly on darkmode, need better transparency)

Rewrite countries of each international league
add more foreign names to all international leagues

money is too difficult to earn in international leagues

all teams are missing colors

INACCURACIES
 some leagues dont have salary caps
 min/max roster sizes aren't accurate in some leagues
 foul rates are off by a bit
 pace needs to be slightly adjusted for some leagues
 
add US presidents to USA expansion file (if i do this, the whole league is cleared of generated players)
  maybe pay an artist to draw some presidents balling out?
