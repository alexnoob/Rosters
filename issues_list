This file has a list of things I need to fix with my files to make them a bit more accurate and enjoyable

Japanese B.League needs transparent logos
CBA logos ugly on dark mode
Rewrite international leagues
add more foreign names to all international leagues
money is too difficult to earn in international leagues
all teams are missing colors
INACCURACIES
 some leagues dont have salary caps
 min/max roster sizes aren't accurate in some leagues
 foul rates are off by a bit
 pace needs to be slightly adjusted for some leagues

Update fantasy
