This file has a list of things I need to fix with my files to make them a bit more accurate and enjoyable

Japanese B.League needs transparent logos

CBA logos ugly on dark mode

Rewrite international leagues or else

more foreign names needed for all international leagues

money is too difficult to earn in international leagues

colleges by country for continents instead of everyone sharing the same pool

INACCURACIES
 some leagues dont have salary caps
 min/max roster sizes aren't accurate in some leagues
 foul rates are off by a bit
 pace needs to be slightly adjusted for some leagues


all damn files need colors, too lazy though
