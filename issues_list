This file has a list of things I need to fix with my files to make them a bit more accurate and enjoyable


finish all players for CBA
do all the players for australia nbl (import all players from someone elses file, they dont mind)

clean up the Japanese B.League (manually add transparent backgrounds thru photoshop)
fix some of the CBA logos (ugly on darkmode, need better transparency)

add more domestic names to
 CBA
 JPN B.League
 VTB United
 fantasy league
add more foreign names to all international leagues

money is too difficult to earn in international leagues

all teams need colors

learn how to auto generate rosters

show africa, south east asia, and south america some love

FIX ALL INACCURACIES
 some leagues dont have salary caps
 min/max roster sizes aren't accurate in some leagues
 foul rates are off by a bit
 pace needs to be slightly adjusted for some leagues
 
add US presidents to USA expansion file
  maybe pay an artist to draw some presidents balling out?
